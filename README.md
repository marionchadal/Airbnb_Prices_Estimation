# Airbnb_Prices_Estimation
For this project, co-directed with Rodrigue Canivez, Jade Esper and Laura Ung, our objective was to produce a method capable of estimating the price of an Airbnb accommodation, depending on its characteristics.
To obtain these characteristics, we did some Web Scraping (cf: Airbnb-Web-Scraping repository). To choose them, we imagined ourselves as owners of a house on Lake Como, in Italy, since it is a dream location. We therefore extracted data concerning this region, in order to obtain the most relevant variables in determining the price.
